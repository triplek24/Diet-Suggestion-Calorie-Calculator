## Installing dependencies

This postinstall script (which would install both dependencies for the backend and frontend) for this project uses yarn, so you should install yarn globally first if you don't have it already.

```sh
npm i -g yarn
```

Then you can simply install the dependencies using the command "yarn" in the root folder

```sh
yarn
```
